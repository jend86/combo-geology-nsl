"""HarnessSpec ABC.

A harness drives the agent loop for one episode. The ABC is deliberately
minimal — a single ``run_episode(ctx) -> HarnessTranscript`` method. Users
extend behavior by subclassing concrete harnesses and the framework's
TracedGenner / EventRecorder instrumentation, not by growing this ABC.
