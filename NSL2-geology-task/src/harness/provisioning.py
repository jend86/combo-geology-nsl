"""Idempotent bootstrap that ensures a harness image exists locally.

Called once per entry point from the main process, before worker slots
spawn. Safe to call multiple times: ``images.get`` short-circuits when
the image is already present (unless ``build.force`` is True).

Not a classmethod on :class:`ContainerHarness` — provisioning is an
orchestrator-level concern, while ContainerHarness is a per-episode
object. Keeping them separate avoids the classmethod-without-cls smell
and makes :func:`ensure_harness_image` trivially usable by
hermes / aiq / other future harnesses without subclassing.
